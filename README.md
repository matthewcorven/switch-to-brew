# switch-to-brew

**Discover macOS apps that aren't managed by [Homebrew](https://brew.sh) — and switch them over in one command.**

Many of us install apps from `.dmg` files, direct downloads, or vendor websites. Over time this creates a patchwork of apps that don't benefit from Homebrew's unified update management (`brew upgrade --cask`). **switch-to-brew** finds those apps, shows you which ones have Homebrew cask equivalents, and lets you selectively adopt them — without reinstalling.

---

## ✨ Features

- 🔍 **Smart discovery** — scans `/Applications` and `~/Applications`, filters out Apple system apps, Homebrew-managed apps, and installers/helpers
- ⚡ **Fast matching** — ships with a curated mapping of 90+ popular apps to their cask tokens; falls back to `brew search` for the rest (with caching)
- 🎯 **Interactive selection** — pick exactly which apps to switch using numbers, ranges, or "all"
- 🔒 **Non-destructive** — uses `brew install --cask --adopt` to link your existing `.app` bundle into Homebrew tracking, no reinstall needed
- 🏃 **Dry-run mode** — see exactly what would happen before committing
- 📋 **Machine-readable output** — TSV and JSON formats for scripting
- 🎨 **Beautiful terminal UI** — colors, spinners, and clean formatting (respects `NO_COLOR`)

## 📦 Installation

### Quick start (run from source)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/matthewcorven/switch-to-brew.git

make install PREFIX="$HOME/.local"
```

### Uninstall

```bash
sudo make uninstall
```

## 🚀 Usage

### Interactive mode (default)

Just run it — it discovers apps, shows matches, and lets you pick:

```
$ switch-to-brew

▸ Found 35 unmanaged apps. Resolving casks...
▸ Matched 28 of 35 apps to Homebrew casks.

### Discover only (no changes)

```bash
switch-to-brew discover          # Pretty table
switch-to-brew discover --json   # JSON output
switch-to-brew list              # TSV for scripting
```

### Switch specific apps

```bash
switch-to-brew switch docker obsidian signal
```

### Switch everything

```bash
switch-to-brew switch --all
```

### Dry run

Preview what would happen without making any changes:

```bash
switch-to-brew --dry-run                # Interactive dry run
switch-to-brew --dry-run switch --all   # Batch dry run
```

### Include Mac App Store apps

By default, App Store apps are excluded (they must be removed from the App Store before Homebrew can manage them). Include them in discovery with:

```bash
switch-to-brew --app-store discover
```

## 🔧 How it works

1. **Scan** — walks `/Applications` and `~/Applications` for `.app` bundles
2. **Filter** — removes Apple system apps (by `com.apple.*` bundle ID), apps already managed by `brew list --cask`, helper/installer bundles, and Mac App Store apps
3. **Match** — resolves each app to a Homebrew cask token:
   - First checks a built-in mapping of 90+ common apps (`data/known_casks.tsv`)
   - Falls back to `brew search --cask` with normalised name variants
   - Results are cached for 5 minutes to speed up repeated runs
4. **Adopt** — runs `brew install --cask <token> --adopt` which tells Homebrew to claim the existing `.app` bundle rather than downloading a fresh copy

### What does `--adopt` do?

When you run `brew install --cask foo --adopt`, Homebrew:
- Downloads the cask metadata (version tracking, uninstall instructions, etc.)
- Sees that the `.app` already exists in `/Applications`
- **Links** the existing app into its tracking system instead of replacing it
- From this point on, `brew upgrade` will manage updates for this app

Your app, its settings, and its data are untouched.

## 🤝 Contributing

Contributions are welcome! Common ways to help:

- **Add entries to `data/known_casks.tsv`** — if you notice an app that isn't matched, add its bundle ID → cask mapping
- **Report mismatches** — if an app is matched to the wrong cask, open an issue
- **Test on different macOS versions** — the more environments tested, the better

### Running the linter

```bash
make lint    # requires shellcheck
```

## ⚠️ Caveats

- **App Store apps** require manual removal from the App Store before Homebrew can manage them. By default they're excluded from discovery.
- **Setapp apps** are discovered and flagged but may not work correctly with `--adopt` since Setapp manages its own app lifecycle.
- **Version mismatches** — if your installed version is very different from what Homebrew's cask currently ships, `--adopt` may still succeed but the next `brew upgrade` will update to the latest cask version.
- Requires **Homebrew** to be installed. Requires **macOS** (this tool uses macOS-specific APIs like `defaults read` and `mdls`).
